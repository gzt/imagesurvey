Purpose of the Survey
---------------------

I am creating a metric for measuring similarity of binary and multiclass
images. This is useful for, eg, comparing classifications of image data
in a way that considers both the structure of the image and the
binary/multiclass nature of the To judge how well it's doing, I have to
get some human feedback.

The survey is a [Shiny app you can
take](http://gzthompson.shinyapps.io/imagesurvey/).
